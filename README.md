# First_project_using_django-to-confirm
My first project in which i implemented the display of information about programming languages.

The website has the following output:
1. All programming languages (which i have in the database);
2. By a certain category;
3. For a separate post;
4. Random language.

In the project, i implemented a form for registration and authentication.
The web interface of the project could be much better, but I don't like html and css :(

p.s.
I apologize for such a file with information about the project, I write it for the first time
